How the scripts work?

Put the following data in your working directory and then run the "run_analysis. R" code in R Studio, 
then an output text file will be generated in your working directory.


- 'x_test.txt': Test data.

- 'x_train.txt': Training data.

- 'features.txt': Feature names for test and training data.

- 'y_test.txt': Activity level for the test data.

- 'y_train.txt': Activity level for the training data.

- 'subject_test.txt': subject number for the test data.

- 'subject_train.txt': subject number for the train data.
